============
This application is used with https://github.com/LosTortugueros/pieAimAndShootServer to connect a bird feeder that will take photos of the birds eating.
The Server (on the other github) is linked to a MakeyMakey that triggers an UDP packet toward this application. On reception, the application takes a photo, 
and stores it on the user's phone.
